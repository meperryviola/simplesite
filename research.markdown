Subfields of particular interest to me include <b> labor, urban, health, and education economics</b>. I am chiefly concerned with systemic inequality and the ways that policy may amplify or alleviate it. I generally gravitate towards questions related to children/familiesâ€™ health, education equity, and intergenerational mobility. 

I wrote my distinguished major thesis on the impacts of variable access to childcare subsidies on labor supply decisions and welfare program participation. In it, I examine the ways in which accessible childcare alters the screening effects of welfare work requirements and whether the presence of accessible childcare reduces the disincentives to work inherent to receipt of welfare benefits. Using the Supplemental Nutrition Access Program as my program of interest, I leverage the 2014 reauthorization of the Child Care Development Block Grant and accompanying nationwide changes to eligibility requirements and recertification periods. This research is ongoing so I decline to post a draft at this time. 


Here is my most recent research paper, from ECON 4880 Policy Analysis Seminar, completed under supervision of L. Friedberg at the University of Virginia. Recipient of UVA Economics Department award for "Best Public Policy Paper By An Undergraduate" 2020-2021.

<h2>Previous research experience:</h2>
<em>2019 - </em>
<b> Accepted presentation at Undergraduate Research Symposium </b>
A research abstract I composed was accepted by the Undergraduate Research Symposium and my colleagues and I presented our study on the viability of a tabletop roleplaying game "Game of Floods" as an effective risk communication artifact. Our presentation was entitled "Game of Floods: Water is Coming" and is [archived](https://digitalcommons.odu.edu/undergradsymposium/2019/commlit/2/) in the ODU Digital Commons.

<b> Invited presentation at Scholars' Day </b>
I was invited to present my research on game-based-learning and climate change risk communication in the format of a poster session held during a larger event called "Scholars' Day", designed to highlight excellence in undergraduate research.
