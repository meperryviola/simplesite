<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I'm a fourth-year undergraduate studying economics and mathematics at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, VA. My interests include labor/public economics, econometrics, technical and scientific communication, and community organizing. In my spare time, I'm a violist and classical soprano.</p>
<p>
I completed my BA with a Distinguished Major in Economics and secondary major in Mathematics in June 2022. I'm a native resident of Norfolk, Virginia and began my education at Old Dominion University in the fall of 2018, where I researched climate risk communication and simulation games as spaces for collective policy determination. I then transferred to the University of Virginia in the fall of 2019, where I developed a passion for econometric analysis.
</p>
<p>
I wrote my undergraduate thesis in Economics on the impacts of variable access to child care subsidies on the labor market behavior and welfare program participation of very low-income parents. I also worked with Leora Friedberg (UVA) and Tony Webb (The New School), assisting with research relating to retired individuals and various Social Security provisions. 
</p>

<p>In July, I will begin work as a Senior Research Assistant for the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.
In my off-hours, Iâ€™m training for a half marathon, reading for pleasure, and playing the viola! </p>
